# Developing Data Products Course Project - Creating Shiny Application

For this project, a relatively simple Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator is created using the Shiny application.  
User will only need to enter their weight and height. Click on "Submit" and their BMI will be calculated. Depending on your BMI, the diagnostic together with the associate risk will also be populated.

For the codes, please refer to "server.R" and "ui.R" in this repository.

The application link can be found here -> https://dorah.shinyapps.io/BMI-Risk/
